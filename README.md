## Highlights of My Journey So Far

I've had the privilege to design and build a custom-made **cryptocurrency** for a client's rewards program, diving deep into the **Ethereum Blockchain** and exploring the capabilities of **JSON-RPC API, Geth (go-ethereum), and Node.js**. This project further solidified our expertise in blockchain application development and tokenization.

I've also lead a team of engineers in a large scale migration project, transforming a legacy system to a more robust and scalable one. We leveraged the power of **Go, AWS, and DynamoDB** to achieve this.

Before stepping into the world of back-end development, I served as an IT Infrastructure Specialist for a major bank in Brazil. Here, I honed my skills in monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining networks, systems, servers, and infrastructure components.

## Continuing Education

I'm currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at Mackenzie University. As an engineer, I am always driven by a curiosity to explore new technologies and understand how they can shape the future of development.
