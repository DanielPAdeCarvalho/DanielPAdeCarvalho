## Highlights of My Journey So Far

I've had the privilege to design and build a custom-made **cryptocurrency** for a client's rewards program, diving deep into the **Ethereum Blockchain** and exploring the capabilities of **JSON-RPC API, Geth (go-ethereum), and Node.js**. This project further solidified my expertise in blockchain application development and tokenization.

I've also led a team of engineers in a large-scale migration project, transforming a legacy system to a more robust and scalable one. We leveraged the power of **Go, AWS, and DynamoDB** to achieve this.

Before stepping into the world of back-end development, I served as an IT Infrastructure Specialist for a major bank in Brazil. Here, I honed my skills in monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining networks, systems, servers, and infrastructure components.
